To address the escalating dispute between student organizations, I would first identify the root cause by engaging in private discussions with key representatives from both groups to understand their perspectives and concerns. A neutral mediation session would be facilitated to promote constructive dialogue and mutual understanding. To immediately defuse tensions, I would issue a joint statement emphasizing unity, professionalism, and a commitment to respectful discourse while urging members to refrain from further public exchanges. Additionally, I would work with both organizations to remove inflammatory content from social media and redirect discussions to a structured forum. For long-term conflict prevention, I would establish clear communication protocols, including designated spokespersons, conflict resolution training, and a code of conduct for online interactions. Encouraging collaboration through joint initiatives and fostering a culture of respect would further strengthen inter-organizational relationships, ensuring future disagreements are resolved constructively without reputational harm.
